# Curiosity-Driven, Clarity-Focused

With a background in journalism, data science, and content marketing, I’ve always been curious about how things work and, more importantly, how to explain them clearly.

## Background and Approach

Ever met someone who's always asking, “Why this? Why that?” That's me. Over the past decade, I've worked across industries like food machinery, industrial services, and software development, discovering that **making the complex simple is what truly drives me**.

My experience in journalism taught me to dig deep, get to the heart of the story, and communicate it in a way that’s easy to follow. It’s this investigative mindset that I bring to technical writing. 

I believe that great documentation goes beyond technical accuracy; **it should anticipate user needs, answer questions before they’re asked, and make complex technology accessible.**

## What Inspired Me to Become a Technical Writer?

**I became a technical writer because I've seen how much clear information can help people.**

My first job, back in 2013 at Netflix support, showed me the impact of plain instructions on user experience. When handling software issues, app bugs, and streaming errors, the right explanation often turned frustration into a positive experience.

In 2015, as a journalism intern at an architecture and construction magazine, interviewing architects and engineers taught me how to translate technical jargon into accessible language, which helped me see the value of simplifying complex information for non-technical audiences.

In 2022, while creating technical content for data science and machine learning courses, I realized that technical writing was not just something I could do, **but something I wanted to do**. 

From freelance projects to my current role as a lead technical writer at [Latitude.sh](), every step of my journey has led me here.

## Why Cloud Documentation?

Cloud technology is both powerful and complex, and I was drawn to it because it’s a field where clear communication is essential. Here, users are dealing with abstract concepts (servers, databases, virtual machines) that don’t have a tangible presence but power their applications and tools. **Without clear guidance, these systems can feel intimidating and inaccessible.**

Just as data analysis depends on accuracy to support decision-making, cloud documentation requires a structured, step-by-step approach to make complex systems understandable. I’ve embraced this process and find it rewarding.

One of the aspects I enjoy most is working closely with developers and engineers, translating their technical knowledge into content that’s accurate and user-centered. 

Ultimately, I chose cloud documentation because it allows me to do what I do best: **take complex technology and make it simple, accessible, and useful for those who need it.**


## Values That Guide My Work

I believe that good documentation is about more than just conveying information. Here are the values that shape my approach:

- **Clarity**: Every word should serve a purpose and be easy to understand.
- **Empathy**: I put myself in the user’s shoes to anticipate their needs and challenges.
- **Consistency**: Documentation should be a reliable, single source of truth.
- **Continuous Improvement**: I view documentation as a living resource that evolves along with the product.

## My Documentation Process

I follow a structured process to ensure that each piece of documentation is clear, accurate, and useful:

1. **Research**: I start by understanding the product and gathering information from experts.
2. **Planning**: I outline the content to make sure it’s logically structured and addresses user needs.
3. **Writing**: I create drafts that focus on clarity, conciseness, and usability.
4. **Review and Feedback**: I work closely with stakeholders to refine content based on their input.
5. **Testing and Iteration**: I test the documentation with real users when possible, refining it based on their feedback.

## Who I Collaborate With

Documentation is a team effort. I regularly collaborate with:

- **Developers**: To understand the product’s technical details and ensure accuracy.
- **Product Managers**: To align documentation with product goals and user needs.
- **Support Teams**: To identify common user questions and issues for troubleshooting guides.
- **Designers**: To enhance the visual clarity and layout of documentation.

## What’s Next for Me?

I’m excited to deepen my expertise in cloud DevOps practices and continue exploring ways to make documentation more interactive and accessible. My goal is to stay ahead of industry trends and keep refining my skills to create documentation that evolves with the needs of both products and users.
