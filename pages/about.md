With a background in journalism, data science, and content marketing. Iâ€™ve always been curious about how things work and, more importantly, how to explain them clearly.

My experience in journalism taught me to dig deep, get to the heart of the story, and communicate it in a way that's easy to follow. It's this investigative mindset that I bring to technical writing. 

I believe that great documentation goes beyond technical accuracy; it should anticipate user needs, answer questions before they're asked, and make complex technology accessible

# What Inspired Me to Become a Technical Writer?

I became a technical writer because I've seen how much clear information can help people.
My first job, back in 2013 at Netflix support, showed me the impact of plain instructions on user experience. When handling software issues, app glitches, and streaming errors, the right explanation can turn frustration into a positive experience.

In 2015, as a journalism intern at an architecture and construction magazine, interviewing architects and engineers taught me how to translate technical jargon into accessible language, which helped me see the value of simplifying complex information for non-technical audiences.

While creating technical content for data science and machine learning courses in 2022, I realized that technical writing was not just something I could do, but something I wanted to do. From freelance projects to my current role as a lead technical writer focused on cloud documentation at Latitude.sh, every step of my journey has led me here.
